PROBLEM STATEMENT:
        The increase in illegal activities, like smuggling valuable forest products, threatens forest preservation worldwide. Detecting and stopping these activities is challenging due to their covert nature. 
        
SOLUTION:
        Our project aims to address this by developing a system using advanced technologies like object detection and image analysis. This system will enable real-time monitoring of forest reserves, helping to identify unauthorized activities promptly. By collaborating with forestry departments and law enforcement, your project aims to empower stakeholders to combat illegal activities effectively, promoting sustainable forest management for the future.

ABOUT THE PROJECT:
     This innovative project addresses the need for advanced data analysis in environmental monitoring by combining aviationtechnology with image scraping methodologies.
As modern challenges such as illegal activities, like smuggling valuable forest products, threatens forest preservation worldwide.The proposed solution involves deploying Aviations equipped with high-resolution cameras and environmental sensors to capture aerial imagery over specific regions.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
By integrating image scraping techniques into the analysis pipeline, the captured images undergo computer vision and machine learning algorithms to extract pertinent details such as changes in vegetation health, wildlife patterns, and landscape alterations.
The project also emphasizes the importance of addressing legal and ethical considerations surrounding aviation usage and data scraping, ensuring compliance with regulations and privacy standards.


FLOW CHART:
![Flow Chart](https://github.com/Chandrahasinisankar/Forest_reservation/blob/main/Environmental%20detection.png)

TECHSTACKS USED:
python, yolov3, open cv, geocoder, scrp,tesseract ocr

HOW TO RUN LOCALLY:
This project consists of detecting fire,weapons and people detection in order to check the count of people to chack if they have any weapons as well as is there any forest fire caught up.In order to run it follow the commands,
        
        python fire.py
        
        python weapon.py
        
        python mail.py

        python ppldetec.py

WHAT'S NEXT:

Disaster Management:
        Emergency response in natural disasters
        Disease surveillance for outbreak monitoring
Crime Detection and Investigation:

Surveillance in high-crime areas:
         Forensic analysis of crime scenes

Agriculture:
        Crop monitoring for disease detection
        Precision agriculture for optimized resource use

Environmental Science:
        Ecological monitoring for biodiversity assessment
        Pollution detection for environmental protection

CONCLUSION:

        Hence this project acts as an aid for the forest reservation,to safe guard animals as well as trees to make our world a better place to live in.

DECLARATION:

        We confirm that project ynder went signifiicat changes and was developed with more innovative ideas entirely during the hackathon within the the given timeframe.
Thank You.
